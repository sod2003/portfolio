  <p>This is my GitHub Page for my portfolio.</p>
  <p>I'm a recent Graduate of Kennesaw State University's Masters of Science in Software Engineering(MSSE).</p>
  <p>I also am currently working for Broadcom as an Associate Consultant for Datacom/DB, a Mainframe Database product.</P>
  
  <p>I've experimented with C, C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, Javascript, and Bash scripting. I have experimented with design patterns in Java and Python. I have web app projects using the Python framework, Flask. I did my capstone project using Python and Tensorflow to build an Image Recognition system(Unfortunately, due to signing a non-disclosure agreement with client, I can't share the engine. I will attempt a similar project in the future).</p>
  
  <p>Current Learning Project: Android Apps</p>
