# Portfolio
All of my notes and experiments, with various programming languages and technologies, are stored in this repository. This repo is also where all my old projects get moved to, formerly being in their own repository before being flattened and moved here.

### Python

* __Algorithms__
A folder for experimenting with data structures and algorithms in Python.

* __Design Patterns__
A folder for experimenting with design patterns in Python
  * Creational

  * Structural

  * Behavioral

* __fundamentals__
A folder for exploring basic concepts and modules in the Python language. 

* __generators__
A folder for displaying the use of generators for iterating through large datasets, and in use with context managers and coroutines.

* __learning-flask__
This folder contains files from a previous attempt at creating a flask app that was hosted on Heroku. It is no longer hosted.

- [X] Built (Must rebuild app.py)
- [ ] Hosted

  A Flask project to showcase a URL shortener functionality.
    - [X] Built
    - [ ] Hosted
  * __weather-app__
  A program with GUI for plotting a set of weather data using matplotlib, tkinter and numpy.

* __python-scripts__
A folder for my Python scripts. This was probably the most fun to experiment with.
  * Script: pythonutils.py - Showcases the use of some Shell Utilities

  * Script: netdata.py - HTTP request for web data

  * Script: jsondata.py - Grabbing, formatting and printing *JSON* data from an online resource [The USGS Earthquake real-time feeds](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

  * Script: htmlparser.py - Custom HTML parser

  * Script: xmlparsing.py - Load and parse XML in memory

* __sockets__
Using the Python socket library to establish mock server and client communications.

* __std-lib__
A folder showcasing the use of modules within the Python standard library.


### Bash-Scripts
A folder for my bash scripts.

### Java

* Fundamentals - Code examples for Java fundamentals.

* Java-Design-Patterns - A collection of my explorations in Design Patterns using Java.

	- [X] Abstract Factory
	- [X] Decorator
	- [X] Template
	- [X] Observer
	- [ ] More to come

* Kotlin - Code examples of Kotlin. Learning for use with Android development.

### js-scripts
A folder for my JavaScript files and experiments.

* Clock - A SVG Clock, made dynamic with JavaScript.

* Typing Speed Test - An interactive program for a Typing Speed Test. Runs a timer until the participant enters the correct text prompt. Continuously checks for spelling errors, giving color-coded feedback.

### C-projects 
A folder for my C files from learning C fundamentals, and will have my future experiments in the language.

### Udacity_MLwithAWS
A folder for exercises completed for an online course for ML tools within AWS.

### Swift
Learning Swift fundamentals, and experimenting with iOS App Development, including individual apps to implement concepts as I learn them. Learning advanced topics in Swift like:
* Design Patterns
* Protocol-Orienting Programming(POP) 
* and Combine.
